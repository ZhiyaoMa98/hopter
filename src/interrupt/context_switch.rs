/// the task for the purpose of doing context switch. On the contrary, other IRQ handlers
/// will always exception return back to the previously running task from the entry
/// function, where callee-saved registers, i.e. those not pushed to the task's stack by
/// the hardware, are lazily preserved onto the kernel stack by the handler functions if
/// they need to use them.
///
/// Safety: This function should only be invoked directly by hardware PendSV exception.

/// FIXME: make sure lazy stacking of floating point registers is properly done.
